2csv was created to convert a file containing a list of email addresses to a string of comma-separated addresses. 

This is just one use of the program. Basically any set of values separated by new-line characer can be converted into CSV format. 

What's the use ? Say, you have a list of strings that need to go into an array in a program. Or like in the first example, a list of email addresses you have to send an email to. 


The tool is easy to use.

To read from a file, say filename, and create a list of CSV, simply use

$ 2csv -f filename

In case you want the values to be separated by ';' instead of ',', then :

$ 2csv -f filename -s ';'

If you want the tool to read from stdin, then 

$ 2csv -s ';'
